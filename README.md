## What-I-enjoyed

Comparing this project to my previous projects using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, I really enjoyed the organization that comes with using NEXT JS. It makes a world of a difference when reading through your code, especially when looking for a specific component or when you are coming back to a project you have not worked on in awhile. I look forward to building more projects with NEXT JS.

It was fun learning how to utilize Tailwind in this project. It is very convenient to style components within the JS file, less going back and forth between files is a huge time saver.
